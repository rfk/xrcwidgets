v0.3.0:

  * Let XRCWidget subclasses participate in two-phase creation
     * this allows you to name an XRCWidget in a 'subclass' attribute of the
       XRC file, and have it create automatically
     * for this to work, it must be possible to call the widget's __init__
       method without arguments; post-initialisation steps should be moved
       to the new "on_create" method.

v0.2.1:

  * Relicensed under the MIT License (I find it simpler than BSD)
  * Don't require the module to be importable in setup.py


v0.2.0:

  * Relicensed under the BSD License
  * Dropped support for python < 2.4 and wxPython < 2.6
  * "VERSION" and related constants are now "__version__" and friends
